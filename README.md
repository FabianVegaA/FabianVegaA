<!--### Hello, everyone, I'm Fabián 😎

🔭 I'm currently a Computer Engineering student at Federico Santa María Technical University, from Chile. I'm also a Python developer and beginning **Haskell** programming language.

🌱 I'm passionate about learn things about functional programming, Haskell, Python, computer science, math, AI etc. Suggestions accepted about books, articles, videos, tutorial and so on. You can find me on Twitter as [@fabianmativeal](https://twitter.com/fabianmativeal).

👐 I'm interested in continuing learning about programming languages (PL), functional programming (FP), math related with the FP, and the technologies related to the Data engineering. Also, I make up one's mind to participate in project of software development that use FP and development of  PL.
