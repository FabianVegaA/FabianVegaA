### Hello, everyone ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ I'm currently a student of Computer Engineering at Universidad TÃ©cnica Fedrico Santa MarÃ­a, from Chile.

ðŸŒ± At this moment, I'm learning each day a bit more about Data Science and Machine Learning, with courses of [Platzi](https://platzi.com/p/fabianveal/) and of other platforms, here you can look more about the courses that I have made [link](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fabi%C3%A1n-vega-alcota-278b37180/).

ðŸ‘¯ I'm looking to collaborate in any project of software, where I can implement techniques like DL or where can use programming languages â€‹â€‹like Python, Haskell, Java, C, or C #, although I'm always willing to learn a lot more.

 ðŸ“« You can reach me in my social networks, here I leave to you some of these [LinkIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fabi%C3%A1n-vega-alcota-278b37180/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/fabianmativeal) y [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/fabianmatias.vegaalcota).
